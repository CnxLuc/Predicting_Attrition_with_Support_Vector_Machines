# Predicting_Attrition_with_Support_Vector_Machines
This simple project aims at predicting attrition with Support Vector Machine, using linear and Radial Basis kernels + a logistic regression. The projects is concluded by testing it (successfully) on a single employee.

This Project was done as a part of my time at LBS.
